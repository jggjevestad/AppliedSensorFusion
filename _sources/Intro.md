# Scope of This Book
This book takes a "learn through examples" approach to the quite complex field of applied sensor fusion. The core idea is to show the reader my draft - how I think and how I approach the problems at hand. This will necessarily leed through some detours here and there, but I still think this approach will provide itself useful when strugeling to navigate the vast complexity of this very interresting and useful topic.

The book aimes at guiding the reader though the basic theory of state estimation accompanied by examples from navigation with mainly robotic platforms. However, the platform at hand may be of any kind and the focus of the reader should not be limited to these platforms - on the contrary the examples should be fairly easy to expand to any kind of dynamic platform, e.g. vehicles, drones and aircrafts.

There are many excellent books out there on this topic already and it is not the intention of this book to compete with any of them by any means. However, it is sometimes difficult to get hold of the basic ideas without having any inituition on how translate them into a practical implementation - that is, building intuition through examples. Haven't you sometimes come across a book that gives you the intuition on a specific topic, the one that you always return to for a quick recap of the main ideas when you start a project? I hope this could be this book for you, and I will do my very best to keep it as straight to the point as possible.

Therefore I hope this book can serve as a valuable source and a starting point for students and engineers that in one way or the other needs some starting point to deal with the more practical problems of *Applied Sensor Fusion*.

## Practical Considerations
The material presented is based on Python for scientific programming, thus a basic knowledge of Python is required to fully exploit all the examples presented in this book.

Installing Python and the suite of libraries that enable scientific computing is straightforward whether you use Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. I would recommend e.g. using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) Open-Source Distribution for easy access to Python and Jupyter notebook. 


## Using Code Examples
Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/jggjevestad/sensor_fusion).

This book is here to help you get a head start to the concept of sensor fusion. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation as you like under the MIT license.

These jupyter notebooks are mostly adapted from lectures given on this topic at the the Norwegian University of Technology (NTNU) and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).


So, with that sorted out, let's begin...
